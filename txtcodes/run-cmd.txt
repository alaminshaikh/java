COMPILE JAVA SOURCE to JAVA CLASS
javac fileName.java

RUN JAVA CLASS
java fileName

FOR JAR FILES 
Add the path to the bin directory of your JDK installation to the list of paths. 
For example, if JDK is installed in C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_311, 
you would add C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_311\bin. (ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES)

RUN JAR FILES (JAVA ARCHIVE)
java -jar fileName.jar


CREATE BATCH FILE TO RUN A PROGRAM
@echo off
java -cp . fileName
pause


JAR CREATE
STEP 1
Create manifext.txt in the current folder. In that file write this. (MyClass will be the fileName)
Manifest-Version: 1.0
Main-Class: fileName

Manifest-Version: 1.0
Main-Class: sum.Main

Replace sum.Main with the fully qualified name of your main class. If your Main class is in a package called sum, and its name is Main, then the fully qualified name would be sum.Main.
Save the file with the name MANIFEST.MF. Make sure to select "All Files" as the file type when saving to ensure it doesn't get saved as MANIFEST.MF.txt.
Place the MANIFEST.MF file in the directory where your compiled .class files are located.
With the MANIFEST.MF file containing the appropriate Main-Class attribute, you can then create your JAR file using the jar command as previously described. 
When you run the JAR file, it will use the specified main class.

STEP 2
Create jar, MyJar is the new name, fileName is the Name for class file that you have.
jar cfm MyJar.jar MANIFEST.MF fileName.class

FOR MANY CLASS
jar cfm MyJar.jar manifest.txt *.class
